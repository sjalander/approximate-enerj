This is the final implementation of EnerJ for the TOLOP project, a master
thesis by Gustaf Borgström, Uppsala University, 2015. The purpose of these
files are to merge all relevant clases together in order to build a correct
memory hierarchy and corresponding error models. Any other found
implementations should not be regarded for others than archiving purposes:
this is the code used for the simulations used in the final report.
